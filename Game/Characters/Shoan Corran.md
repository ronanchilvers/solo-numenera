### Swift
- **Fast**: +4 to your Speed Pool.  
- **Skill**: You’re trained in initiative actions (to determine who goes first in combat). 
- **Skill**: You’re trained in running actions. 
- **Inability**: You’re fast but not necessarily graceful. Any task involving balance is hindered.

### Glaive
- **Effort**: Your Effort is 1.  
- **Fighter**: You have a Might Edge of 1, a Speed Edge of 1, and an Intellect Edge of 0.  
- **Cypher Use**: You can bear two cyphers at a time.
- **Combat Prowess**: You add +1 damage to melee attacks. Enabler.
- **Trained in Armor**: You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You reduce the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor by 1. Enabler.
- **Weapons**: You can use any weapon without penalty.
- **Physical Skills**: Trained in climbing.
- **Inability**: You have an inability in crafting numenera, salvaging numenera, and understanding numenera.
- **Fighting Moves - Misdirect**: (3 Speed points) When an opponent misses you, you can redirect their attack to another target (a creature or object) of your choosing that’s within immediate range of you. Make an unmodified attack roll against the new target (do not use any of your or the opponent’s modifiers to the attack roll, but you can apply Effort for accuracy). If the attack hits, the target takes damage from your opponent’s attack. Enabler.

### Moves Like A Cat

- **Balance**: You are trained in balancing. Enabler.
