- Shoan blinks, his eyes feeling gummy and glued shut. His body feels stiff and cold without its usual flexibility and strength. He tries to sit up but needs several attempts before he manages it. He scrubs his hands across his eyes - it feels as if he has a terrible hangover. His vision is blurry as he looks around.

> [!oracle] Is Shoan inside somewhere?
> **Roll:** 35
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!question] Thread
> - [x] #thread  Find out where Shoan is

> [!oracle] Is it dark?
> **Roll:** 11
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** Move away from thread / Timidly Abnormal

Shoan shivers. It is pitch black - he can see nothing despite his eyes being wide open. He feels a coldness seeping into him, the coldness of fear. He isn't used to it - he's no stranger to danger but something is playing on his nerves, something more than the pitch darkness. He gropes for his pack in the darkness.

> [!oracle] Does he still have his pack?
> **Roll:** 37
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He feels the synth reinforced canvas of his pack under his hand and breathes a sigh of relief. He gropes in the pack for a glowglobe. He finds the device and pulling it out, gropes for the activation switch and thumbs it on. The dim light illuminates his surroundings just enough to see.

> [!oracle] Is Shoan inside a cave?
> **Roll:** 88
> **Outcome:** Ex No / Colourfully Tall
> **Random Event:** None

He seems to be sitting on a metallic floor. Panels of iridescent metal gleam in the dim light. They are slotted seamlessly together to make a broad surface which seems to curve upwards to smoothly grooved walls of metal. He can't see a ceiling but the darkness is quite absolute above him. Shoan struggles to his feet.

> [!oracle] Is he wounded in some way?
> **Roll:** 13
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!roll] Whereabouts is he hurt?
> **Result:** 5 - Right arm

He reaches out to the wall to steady himself and gasps in pain - his right arm is stiff and painful, his sleeve soaked with dried blood. He gingerly tests with his fingers, finding a deep gash in his upper arm near the shoulder. It seems to have stopped bleeding.

> [!oracle] Does he remember how he got here?
> **Roll:** 15
> **Outcome:** Yes / Fortunately Harsh
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] Was he with other people?
> **Roll:** 4
> **Outcome:** Ex Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] Were they attacked?
> **Roll:** 60
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

He closes his eyes, trying to remember how he came here. He remembers a lot of people, travelling with them to get ... somewhere. He remembers them arriving at their destination ... a huge glistening iridescent obelisk floating about 20 feet from the ground in a small valley, hidden from sight by the surrounding forest. Forest!! He remembers the journey through the forest. He remembers their arrival at the obelisk, staring up at the impossibly tall shape. The nano... what was his name... he wanted to go inside it.

Shoan shakes his head. He feels groggy, nauseous. He lifts the glowglobe high and peers around. Looks like they did get inside... somehow!

> [!oracle] Is there an obvious doorway?
> **Roll:** 43
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He sees, a little further round the wall from him, the outline of a door or hatch in the metal wall. Stumbling a little, he moves across to it and examines it carefully. 

> [!oracle] Is there an obvious way of opening the door?
> **Roll:** 55
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

He can't see any obvious way for the door to open. He shines the glowglobe around, searching for any other entrances.

> [!oracle] Are there any other potential exits?
> **Roll:** 36
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He spots an opening, blocked by a metal grill, at head height on the opposite side of the space. The opening looks like some sort of ventilation duct. He walks across to it and pushing his fingers into the grill, he tugs at it.

> [!roll] How strong is the grill?
> **Result:** 6

The grill is bolted in place. Shoan hauls at it, trying to pull it free.

> [!roll] Break the grill free
> **Target Number:** 6
> **Effort:** 0
> **Result:** 12

He strains hard but the grill doesn't move. Frustrated, Shoan looks around for any other way out.

> [!oracle] Is there another exit?
> **Roll:** 63 / very unlikely
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

The metal walls are sheer. Apart from the embedded door and the duct there is no way out. Shoan crosses back to the door and examines the surround, looking for some way to open it.

> [!roll] Can he find some clue to opening the door?
> **Target Number:** 5
> **Effort:** 0
> **Result:** 14

He finds nothing - the door is a tight fit in it's surround. He tries a shoulder against it - can he just break it open?

> [!roll] Break the door open
> **Target Number:** 7
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 16

He bounces off the door, the impact sending shooting pains through his good shoulder. He breathes hard, frustrated, the creeping fear he felt earlier beginning to heighten. He leans against the metal wall for a moment, catching his breath, waiting for the flare of pain in his shoulder to calm down. What to do now? Try the door again? Or attempt to break the grill on the duct?

The door is likely to be safer since he doesn't know where the duct leads. On the other hand the duct is likely to be easier to force open. He decides to try the duct. He pulls one of his climbing spikes and hammer from his pack. Using the spike like a chisel, he starts to hammer at the frame of the duct grill, trying to break it open.

> [!roll] Lever open the duct grill
> **Target Number:** 5
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 8

The grill, although damaged, refuses to separate from the surrounding wall. He throws the hammer to the ground in frustration. He decides to try to just smash the grill open by breaking and bending back the mesh.

> [!roll] Break and bend the mesh
> **Target Number:** 3
> **Effort:** 0
> **Result:** 2

He smashes the hammer into the grill mesh but it seems much stronger than it looks and remains intact. His nerves are taught now. He is on edge. He decides to try the door again. Maybe he can hammer the climbing spikes into the surround - if it slides he might be able to lever it open.

> [!oracle] Is it a sliding door?
> **Roll:** 75 / Nearly certain
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

Shoan grabs his other climbing spikes and wedging the tip of one into the crack of the door as much as he can, he begins to hammer. There is desperation in his hammer blows. He can feel that he's getting tired and tries to force down the intense fear that is gripping him. 

> [!roll] Hammer the spikes into the door jamb
> **Target Number:** 4
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 6

He manages to drive one of the spikes home but the other two won't stay. He tries again.

> [!roll] Attempt to hammer the spikes in again
> **Target Number:** 4
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 16

This time it works! He drives all three spikes into the door jamb, opening a gap. It _is_ a sliding door! He pushes his fingers into the gap opened by the spikes and hauls hard. He is on the edge of exhaustion.

> [!roll] haul open the door
> **Target Number:** 5
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 1

> [!warning] GM Intrusion
> **Result:** His hands slip and knock the spikes out.

As he pulls he braces his feet against the door jamb. His hand slips, he loses balance and falls backwards. His feet kick up and dislodge all three spikes from the door, which immediately slides shut again with a crisp *sccchhhlunk*. Shoan collapses back against the metal wall and let's out a yell of frustration and rage. Exhausted, he slumps back against the wall, his hand and leg aching from the fall. He takes a moment to rest against the metal wall, unyielding though it is. He closes his eyes.

*His mind drifts. He remembers the journey through the forest, the nano keeping himself to himself, unwilling to speak to anyone. He remembers when they entered the valley; seeing the obelisk for the first time; the look on the nano's face - hunger, greed. He remembers watching the nano later that day, wondering what his real purpose was. He remembers telling Joya ... Joya!! He remembers Joya!!*

> [!question] Character
> - [ ] #character  Joya

> [!oracle] Recovery roll - 4, 4

He opens his eyes. The glowglobe hovers in the air just above him. He gets to his feet, finds the climbing spikes, the hammer and bracing himself, begins to once again hammer the spikes home.

> [!roll] Hammer the spikes into the now damaged door jamb
> **Target Number:** 3
> **Effort:** 0
> **Result:** 10

The spikes wedge in more easily this time. He makes sure they are secure, outs down the hammer and once again works his fingers into the gap. He pauses for a moment, uttering a murmured prayer, braces himself and pulls hard.

> [!roll] Haul the door open
> **Target Number:** 5
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 1

> [!warning] GM Intrusion
> **Result:** 1d3 spikes break - 2

The door gives a little but then slams shut again. Two of the three climbing spikes snap and ping off into the darkness. The third clatters to the ground. Shoan begins to feel real fear. Is he going to die in this place? What if he can't get out. He wants to see Joya again - where is she?

He walks back across to the duct opening and peers in, trying to see if he missed anything the first time.

> [!oracle] Did he miss anything?
> **Roll:** 27 / Unlikely
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He gestures the glowglobe closer and sees that the frame is thinner of one side. It wasn't visible before but the damage he caused with the climbing spikes has revealed it. He grabs the remaining spike and works itmunder the frame at the thinner section. Then he grips the hammer, raises it high and brings it down with an almighty crash.

> [!roll] Can he break the grill frame?
> **Target Number:** 4
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 18

With a loud metallic ping, the frame pops free of the duct entrance. Shoan breathes a sigh of relief - finally something goes right!!

He pulls himself up to peer down the duct. He sends the glowglobe a little way in. It is big enough for him to crawl along although he'll have to pull his pack behind him. He grits his teeth - tight spaces aren't his favourite thing but the alternative is staying in here. He grabs his pack, stuffs the hammer and remaining spike back in and then climbs up into the duct. Pulling his pack behind him he begins to crawl along the duct, the glowglobe illuminating the tunnel ahead of him.

> [!roll] What percentage of the glowglobe power has been used?
> **Result:** 28%

The duct continues straight for a few meters before it branches. The main duct travels onwards but the new branch heads at right angles to it.

> [!oracle] is the new branch an exit?
> **Roll:** 86 / 50-50
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

The new branch heads off into darkness. Shoan decides to continue following the original duct. He crawls further along. He is weary and his pack keeps jamming against the sides of the duct. Before too long the duct branches again.

> [!oracle] Is this new branch an exit?
> **Roll:** 55 / 50-50
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

This time Shoan decides to follow the new branch which leads off at an angle from the one he is already following.

> [!oracle] Is the new branch an exit?
> **Roll:** 95 / Very likely
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

He crawls forwards until the duct turns upwards, the corner to cramped for him to navigate. He begins the arduous process of reversing back to the junction. Once he reaches it starts off again, following the original ducting.

> [!oracle] Does he find an exit?
> **Roll:** 74 / Nearly certain
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] Does the duct exit inside the obelisk?
> **Roll:** 88 / Very likely
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] Is it day time?
> **Roll:** 49 / 50-50
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He crawls forward until he sees ahead of him a glimmer of light. The duct starts to angle downwards and before he can stop himself he starts to slide on the sheer metal. He tries to stop his slide using his feet.

> [!roll] Brace himself to stop his slide
> **Target Number:** 3
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 12

He thrusts his hands and feet out to stop his slide. The metal of the duct is sheer but he manages to slow and then stop himself. He grits his teeth and then slowly let's himself slide, little by little towards the end of the duct. He reaches the end and peers out. It is late afternoon and he can see the twilit sky above trees.

> [!oracle] Is he close to the ground?
> **Roll:** 28 / Unlikely
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

The duct seems to exit the shell of the obelisk about 14 or 15 feet from the ground. Shoan wonders how to drop out, head first, without ending up a crumpled heap on the ground. He tries to maneuver himself out of the duct while keep a grip on the sheer metal.

> [!roll] Exit the duct and drop to the ground safely
> **Target Number:** 4
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 8

He almost makes it but at the last moment his foot slips and he tumbles to the ground below.

> [!oracle] 2 points of damage

> [!oracle] Is he alone?
> **Roll:** 3 / Very likely
> **Outcome:** Ex Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He groans as he rolls over and struggles to sit up. His shoulder hit the ground and is bleeding freely again. He shakes his head to clear it and waits for the pain to subside again. After a moment, he lifts his head and looks around. His vision is blurry. He can see a circle of figures standing around him. He hears raised voices. He shakes his head, pushing himself up onto his knees. He looks up and sees the nano. He is standing a little way off, his hands clasped in the sleeves of his coat as usual. He is gazing down at Shoan, his unnaturally blue eyes bright in the evening sunlight. Shoan suddenly remembers his name.
