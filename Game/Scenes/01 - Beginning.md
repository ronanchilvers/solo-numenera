> [!question] Thread
> - [ ] #thread  GM Intrusion

- Shoan blinks, his eyes feeling gummy and glued shut. His body feels stiff and cold without its usual flexibility and strength. He tries to sit up but needs several attempts before he manages it. He scrubs his hands across his eyes - it feels as if he has a terrible hangover. His vision is blurry as he looks around.

> [!oracle] Is Shoan inside somewhere?
> **Roll:** 35
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!question] Thread
> - [ ] #thread  Find out where Shoan is

> [!oracle] Is it dark?
> **Roll:** 11
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** Move away from thread / Timidly Abnormal

Shoan shivers. It is pitch black - he can see nothing despite his eyes being wide open. He feels a coldness seeping into him, the coldness of fear. He isn't used to it - he's no stranger to danger but something is playing on his nerves, something more than the pitch darkness. He gropes for his pack in the darkness.

> [!oracle] Does he still have his pack?
> **Roll:** 37
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He feels the synth reinforced canvas of his pack under his hand and breathes a sigh of relief. He gropes in the pack for a glowglobe. He finds the device and pulling it out, gropes for the activation switch and thumbs it on. The dim light illuminates his surroundings just enough to see.

> [!oracle] Is Shoan inside a cave?
> **Roll:** 88
> **Outcome:** Ex No / Colourfully Tall
> **Random Event:** None

He seems to be sitting on a metallic floor. Panels of iridescent metal gleam in the dim light. They are slotted seamlessly together to make a broad surface which seems to curve upwards to smoothly grooved walls of metal. He can't see a ceiling but the darkness is quite absolute above him. Shoan struggles to his feet.

> [!oracle] Is he wounded in some way?
> **Roll:** 13
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!roll] Whereabouts is he hurt?
> **Result:** 5 - Right arm

He reaches out to the wall to steady himself and gasps in pain - his right arm is stiff and painful, his sleeve soaked with dried blood. He gingerly tests with his fingers, finding a deep gash in his upper arm near the shoulder. It seems to have stopped bleeding.

> [!oracle] Does he remember how he got here?
> **Roll:** 15
> **Outcome:** Yes / Fortunately Harsh
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] Was he with other people?
> **Roll:** 4
> **Outcome:** Ex Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] Were they attacked?
> **Roll:** 60
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

He closes his eyes, trying to remember how he came here. He remembers a lot of people, travelling with them to get ... somewhere. He remembers them arriving at their destination ... a huge glistening iridescent obelisk floating about 20 feet from the ground in a small valley, hidden from sight by the surrounding forest. Forest!! He remembers the journey through the forest. He remembers their arrival at the obelisk, staring up at the impossibly tall shape. The nano... what was his name... he wanted to go inside it.

Shoan shakes his head. He feels groggy, nauseous. He lifts the glowglobe high and peers around. Looks like they did get inside... somehow!

> [!oracle] Is there an obvious doorway?
> **Roll:** 43
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He sees, a little further round the wall from him, the outline of a door or hatch in the metal wall. Stumbling a little, he moves across to it and examines it carefully. 

> [!oracle] Is there an obvious way of opening the door?
> **Roll:** 55
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

He can't see any obvious way for the door to open. He shines the glowglobe around, searching for any other entrances.

> [!oracle] Are there any other potential exits?
> **Roll:** 36
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He spots an opening, blocked by a metal grill, at head height on the opposite side of the space. The opening looks like some sort of ventilation duct. He walks across to it and pushing his fingers into the grill, he tugs at it.

> [!roll] How strong is the grill?
> **Result:** 6

The grill is bolted in place. Shoan hauls at it, trying to pull it free.

> [!roll] Break the grill free
> **Target Number:** 6
> **Effort:** 0
> **Result:** 12

He strains hard but the grill doesn't move. Frustrated, Shoan looks around for any other way out.

> [!oracle] Is there another exit?
> **Roll:** 63 / very unlikely
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

The metal walls are sheer. Apart from the embedded door and the duct there is no way out. Shoan crosses back to the door and examines the surround, looking for some way to open it.

> [!roll] Can he find some clue to opening the door?
> **Target Number:** 5
> **Effort:** 0
> **Result:** 14

He finds nothing - the door is a tight fit in it's surround. He tries a shoulder against it - can he just break it open?

> [!roll] Break the door open
> **Target Number:** 7
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 16

He bounces off the door, the impact sending shooting pains through his good shoulder. He breathes hard, frustrated, the creeping fear he felt earlier beginning to heighten.
