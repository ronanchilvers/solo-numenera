- Shoan blinks, his eyes feeling gummy and glued shut. His body feels stiff and cold without its usual flexibility and strength. He tries to sit up but needs several attempts before he manages it. He scrubs his hands across his eyes - it feels as if he has a terrible hangover. His vision is blurry as he looks around.

Shoan shivers. It is pitch black - he can see nothing despite his eyes being wide open. He feels a coldness seeping into him, the coldness of fear. He isn't used to it - he's no stranger to danger but something is playing on his nerves, something more than the pitch darkness. He gropes for his pack in the darkness.

> [!oracle] Does he still have his pack?
> **Roll:** 37
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He feels the synth reinforced canvas of his pack under his hand and breathes a sigh of relief. He gropes in the pack for a glowglobe. He finds the device and pulling it out, gropes for the activation switch and thumbs it on. The dim light illuminates his surroundings just enough to see.

> **Roll:** 88
> **Outcome:** Ex No / Colourfully Tall
> **Random Event:** None

He seems to be sitting on a metallic floor. Panels of iridescent metal gleam in the dim light. They are slotted seamlessly together to make a broad surface which seems to curve upwards to smoothly grooved walls of metal. He can't see a ceiling but the darkness is quite absolute above him. Shoan struggles to his feet.

> [!oracle] Is he wounded in some way?
> **Roll:** 13
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!roll] Whereabouts is he hurt?
> **Result:** 5 - Right arm

He reaches out to the wall to steady himself and gasps in pain - his right arm is stiff and painful, his sleeve soaked with dried blood. He gingerly tests with his fingers, finding a deep gash in his upper arm near the shoulder. It seems to have stopped bleeding.

> [!oracle] Does he remember how he got here?
> **Roll:** 15
> **Outcome:** Yes / Fortunately Harsh
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] Was he with other people?

He closes his eyes, trying to remember how he came here. He remembers a lot of people, travelling with them to get ... somewhere. He remembers them arriving at their destination ... a huge glistening obelisk floating about 20 feet from the ground in a small valley, hidden from sight by the surrounding forest. Forest!! He remembers the journey through the forest. He remembers their arrival at the obelisk, staring up at the impossibly tall shape. The nano... what was his name... he wanted to go inside it.

Shoan shakes his head. He feels groggy, nauseous. He lifts the glowglobe high and peers around. Looks like they did get inside... somehow!

> [!oracle] Is there an obvious doorway?
> **Roll:** 43
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He sees, a little further round the wall from him, the outline of a door or hatch in the metal wall. Stumbling a little, he moves across to it and examines it carefully.
