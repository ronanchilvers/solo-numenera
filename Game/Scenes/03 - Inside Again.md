Shoan cautiously moves through the doorway into the interior of the obelisk. There is a short corridor and then he finds himself at the top of a flight of stairs leading downwards.

> [!oracle] Is it dark?
> **Roll:** 82
> **Outcome:** No / 50-50
> **Random Event:** None

A soft glow from wall mounted panels flickers on as he moves, keeping pace with him, enough to illuminate the stairway for a good few feet.

> [!oracle] Is there any danger here?
> **Roll:** 1
> **Outcome:** Ex Yes / Unlikely 
> **Random Event:** None

Shoan begins to descend the stairs. He is cautious, stepping carefully on each step. He is about half way down and can see the bottom of the stairs when he notices tendrils of what looks like mist, a smoky writhing drift of something just a few feet in front of him. He stops and glances back up the stair to make sure of his way out. The lights are still on above him and he can see the evening sunlight through the doorway, but between him and the door, the same tendrils of mist are drifting slowly across the corridor. He begins to hear a noise, a low whispering, as of many voices, just on the edge of hearing.

> [!oracle] Does Shoan remembers this from his previous visit?
> **Roll:** 2
> **Outcome:** Exe Yes / Very Likely 
> **Random Event:** None

Suddenly he remembers. He remembers this stair, the wisps of smoky mist, the strange whispering voices. He remembers them standing here together.

*"What is that?" Joya pokes at the wisps of smoke with her blade. "Some sort of mist?" Shoan frowns - "Can you hear that? Sounds like whispering." Joya shakes her head - "Your imagination - I always said it was a bit too active!" She steps forward down the corridor. The mist swirls, the whispering intensifying, eager. Shoan shouts - "Joya! Wait!*

Memory floods back. The mist! He hears the whispering intensify - just like last time except that now, *he* is the target. Like last time the mist suddenly solidifies, the tendrils becoming spiked blades that dart towards him. The whispering becomes an excited shrieking. It is hungry.

`class: track`
> [!abstract] Blade Mist
> **Level:** 5
> **TN (3 x Level):** 15

> [!abstract] Initiative
> - 18 - Shoan
> - 15 - Mist

Shoan throws himself forwards to avoid the blade, hoping to roll under and past the tendrils. He knows he won't be able to fight this thing on his own.

> [!roll] Shoan tries to roll under the tendrils, back to his feet and then sprint down the corridor.
> **Target Number:** 5/15
> **Effort:** 1 Speed
> **Result:** 10

He throws himself forwards, trying to roll under the darting blades. He gets past but isn't fast enough getting to his feet. He loses his balance for a moment and staggers against the wall, still within range of the blades. They dart towards him.

> [!roll] Defend against the attack
> **Target Number:** 5/15
> **Effort:** 1
> **Result:** 20 / Major Effect

Shoan twists aside as the blades slash towards him. He rolls against the wall, ducking out of the way and throwing himself head first along the corridor. He manages to bring his legs up and rolls forwards and onto his feet, breaking into a run. The lights of the corridor flicker on around him and behind him the shrieking of the mist fades. He turns a corner and skids to a halt in the doorway of a large chamber.
