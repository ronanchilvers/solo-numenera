[[T'ikon]] walks slowly over towards Shoan. He stops a few feet away and looks down at him his head cocked to one side.

"Shoan? Shoan can you hear me?"

> [!oracle] Did Joya enter the obelisk as well?
> **Roll:** 88 / Nearly certain 
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

He calls out to the others

"Any sign of the other one?"

Shoan hears someone reply but doesn't understand the words. [[T'ikon]] crouches in front of him.

"Your friend is still inside. Was she with you? Did something happen to her?"

Shoan blinks hard, trying to focus. Although he is tired, his mind is still sharp. The fear he felt previously is ebbing away. Vague memories surface - arriving at the obelisk with [[T'ikon]] and the others; [[T'ikon]] undertaking some sort of ritual in front of it; a doorway... a doorway opening in the smooth bulk of the thing; a dark interior revealed inside. 

*Joya standing next to him, her voice nervous as she says "Starting to have second thoughts about this deal Corran. How much is he paying us again?" Shoan shrugs - "A lot". Joya sighs - "Best get on with it then". They step forward, up the ramp to the doorway that has slid open in the obelisk. Shoan draws his blade, hearing the metallic whisper of Joya's blade leaving its scabbard as well.*

> [!oracle] Were they attacked by something inside the obelisk?
> **Roll:** 10
> **Outcome:** Ex Yes / 50-50
> **Random Event:** None

Shoan looks up. 

"We went inside - like we agreed. There was something in there. A lot of them."

Shoan finds snatches of memory beginning to return.

*There is a low hum as they walk up the ramp. Joya is cautious as always, her steps light and precise. They walk through the doorway.*

He stands and turns towards it - the doorway they went through is there in front of him. He can see the ramp they walked up.

"Where is she? Where's Joya? Did she come out?"

His voice is urgent. [[T'ikon]] moves up beside him. 

"We've not seen her since you went inside. She must be still in there."

Shoan grits his teeth - "Dammit."

> [!oracle] Does he still have his sword?
> **Roll:** 8
> **Outcome:** Ex Yes / 50-50
> **Random Event:** None

He grips the hilt of his sword, drawing it smoothly. It is humming with energy, the monoblade crackling and sparking. [[T'ikon]] steps back and Shoan strides forward up the ramp.
