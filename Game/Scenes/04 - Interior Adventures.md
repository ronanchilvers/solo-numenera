Shoan is standing at the edge of a huge chamber. It seems larger than should be possible given the dimensions of the obelisk. The chamber is vaulted with vast arches sweeping upwards towards a central point in the darkness above. The walls seem to be made of some sort of dark glass, spidered with cracks and fissures. The floor of the chamber seems to be made of a similar glass-like substance and is luminescent, a dim blue-green glow illuminating the smooth surface.

> [!oracle] Is Joya here?
> **Roll:** 83 / 50-50
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

The chamber seems to be deserted apart from what looks like a darkly gleaming rod of metal or glass which is floating suspended a few feet from the ground in the centre of the chamber, directly below the confluence of the vault arches.

Shoan stands, catching his breath. The mist doesn't penetrate this far down the corridor but the echoes of its shrieking are still audible behind him. Joya is nowhere to be seen. He edges forwards into the chamber, careful to keep his footing on the slick glass of the floor. The luminous glow seems to almost stick to his feet as he moves slowly around the edge of the chamber.

As he cautiously moves forwards into the chamber towards the floating rod, looking out for anything dangerous he begins to see movement beneath his feet, beneath the glass. Dark shapes with traceries of light swirl slowly around where his boots touch the glass. They move faster keeping pace with him, almost predicting where his next step will fall. He stops, unsure whether to go on or flee.

Just ahead of him, the glass begins to flow towards a single point, as if suddenly superheated and liquid. Beneath the floor the swirling shapes become frantic, moving too fast to keep track of. A bulge in the glass pushes upwards, slowly growing until the column of glass stands as tall as him. Gradually the column shifts and flexes, slowly transforming into a humanoid shape.

> [!oracle] Does the figure take the appearance of Joya?
> **Roll:** 87 / Very unlikely
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

Shoan backs away from the forming figure, glancing around him for anything that might help him, might give him some context or clue to what's happening.

> [!roll] Does he see anything helpful?
> **Target Number:** 6
> **Effort:** 0
> **Result:** 1

> [!warning] GM Intrusion
> **Result:** He slips on the glass floor and falls prone on his back

As he edges backwards, his feet slip and before he knows what's happening, he crashes backwards onto the glass floor, landing hard on his back and knocking the breath out of him. The figure has formed now and there is a cracking noise as it snaps it's feet free of the floor. It glitters as it steps forward and bends over him.

> [!roll] What is the attitude of the figure?
> **Result:** 3 - Neutral

The figure bends further forwards. The face is blank and smooth, featureless. A thin beam of light suddenly springs from its forehead, piercing the gloom to flicker across Shoan's face, playing back and forth as if searching for something.

Shoan holds his hands up - "I'm not here to harm you. I'm looking for a friend. I just want to find her and leave." There is a pause and then the figure speaks. There is no mouth but the voice comes from it as surely as Shoan's comes from him. It is sharp, grating.

"Organism identified as human. Male. Approximately 40 years of age. Request purpose and identity."

Shoan tries to keep his voice steady - "Shoan Corran. I'm looking for my friend who came in here a little while ago."

> [!roll] Shoan convinces the figure that he is not a threat
> **Target Number:** 3
> **Effort:** 0
> **Result:** 19

The figure says nothing, the light continues to play back and forth across his face. It straightens suddenly, it's movement fluid and precise.

"Pulse and respiratory rates are elevated. Common stress patterns detected. Compensating."

The figure once again begins to flow and change. This time detail begins to emerge, the dark glass surface becoming opaque, changing colour and texture as it adopts the form of a human male, dressed in clothes similar to Shoan's own. The man seems to be in his mid to late thirties, slight stubble on his face. There is are thin scars on his right cheek. The man squats down next to Shoan and holds out a hand.

"Easier to talk like this I think. I'm Thaeox - pleased to meet you."

> [!question] Character
> - [ ] #character Thaeox 

Shoan struggles into a sitting position and tentatively reaches out to take the man's hand. It is warm, to all appearances a living human hand. Thaeox stands and helps Shoan to his feet.

> [!oracle] Does Thaeox know that Shoan and Joya entered the obelisk before?
> **Roll:** 30 / Very likely
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

"You're looking for a friend you said? You've been in here before - I recognise you."

Shoan nods, somewhat bewildered by Thaeox sudden appearance.

"My friend and I came in here a while back. I don't remember much about it. I was trapped - managed to climb out of a ventilation duct. She's still in here somewhere - I need to find her."

Thaeox nods - "A ventilation duct, eh? Eeshk - that must have been fun! Lucky there wasn't a purge while you were in it." He sees Shoan's look of puzzlement - "Oh - a purge is when the ventilation system cleans itself. Boiling vapour is pumped through it." He grins - "Probably would have roasted you."

Shoan swallows hard. "Who... who are you?"

> [!oracle] Is Thaeox the control AI for the obelisk?
> **Roll:** 17 / Nearly certain
> **Outcome:** Ex Yes
> **Random Event:** None

Thaeox looks puzzled for a moment and then - "Oh sorry! I've not told you that have I!" - He pauses for a second scratching his beard. "I'm ... well I'm ... hmm. Hard to explain in words. I live here - this is my place. I control this structure." He bows and a warm smile lights his face - "At your service!"

Shoan nods - "Good to meet you. I'm sorry we invaded your space."

Thaeox' head tilts a little - "Ah yes - what *are* you doing here? Looking for something? Who are the group of surly brutes outside. One of them seems to be able to communicate with me."

Shoan says - "That'll be T'ikon. He's a nano. I don't understand it but he's good with tech. The others are mercenaries - like me I guess. T'ikon hired us in Curtaris, Joya and me. He wanted someone to come out here with him and, as it turns out, someone to come in here ahead of him."

Thaeox nods - "I understand. Like the sin-eaters of old - he wanted you to take the risks so that he could get the pay off."

Shoan says urgently - "Do you know where Joya is? You must know surely? Where did she go?"

> [!oracle] Does Thaeox know where Joya is?
> **Roll:** 41 / Nearly certain
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

> [!oracle] Is Joya still alive?
> **Roll:** 8 / 50-50
> **Outcome:** Ex Yes
> **Random Event:** None

Thaeox looks at him fora moment. His eyes glitter in the dim light. "She is unharmed. I can take you to her if you like." Shoan nods - "Take me there. Now! ... Please." This last comes out as an after thought. His relief that Joya is alive surges through him. Thaeox stands motionless for a moment looking at him. Then he nods and turns, walking quickly away across the chamber.

"This way! Follow, follow."

Shoan follows, half running to catch up. They walk directly across the chamber, very close to the floating rod in the centre. Shoan can see it is made of the same glass-like material that the floor and walls are and that it seems to be filled with a swirling pattern if lights.

"What is that?" He asks Thaeox as he hurried to keep up. Thaeox doesn't break his stride. He glanced at the rod. "That? Oh .. well, that's me. Sort of. It's where the 'me' of me is at least. That doesn't really make sense does it. Well - probably enough to say that it is the point in which control of this vessel is located. Clever thing too! Even though it's sort of me, it still gives me a headache when I think about it."

Shoan looks back at the rod. It seems to have changed shape or maybe size, he can't quite tell. It makes his eyes feel odd to look at it.

They walk briskly to the other side of the chamber, to an opening in the wall. Thaeox walks straight in without hesitation and Shoan, after a moment of hesitation, follows. Thaeox stops in what seems to be an alcove in the wall. "Come in. Make sure nothing is sticking out of the opening or you might lose it. All in? Good."

Suddenly the sides of the opening flex and ripple, flowing rapidly together. In moments they are encased in a bubble in the glass wall. Shoan has a sickening sense of impossibly rapid movement, of surging upwards, then of a sudden halt. He staggers, putting out a hand to steady himself. As he does so the wall vanishes, flowing back into itself. Thaeox steps through the new gap into a different chamber. This one is similarly vast and is flooded with light. The walls seem to be transparent and Shoan can see the surrounding countryside clearly. They seem to be hundreds of feet above the ground. The setting sun hangs just above the horizon, flooding the forest around them with evening light. He steps out of the alcove, following Thaeox.

> [!oracle] Is Joya here?
> **Roll:** 90 / Likely
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

The chamber is empty apart from a structure of some sort in the centre. Shoan says "Is she here? Where is she?" Thaeox grins at him - "She's not here. Not yet. She will be in a moment." He turns to gaze out at the setting sun. "Ah! Here she is." Raising a hand, he points.

Shoan turns to look and sees a thin column of light appear between the floor and ceiling of the chamber. The column is incredibly bright and Shoan squints, shielding his eyes with his hands. The column broadens, swelling into a pillar several feet across. Within the light Shoan sees a figure. It is crouching  on the floor, its arms over its head.

The light flares and slowly dies. As his eyes re-adjust he sees that figure is a woman. She is kneeling on one knee on the floor. She is wearing travelling clothes similar to his own. He can see a cloak dropped around her. The cloak has slashes in it and the clothes beneath are similarly cut.

*Joya walks forward into the corridor. Shoan shouts - "Joya! Wait!!". The whispering intensifies into a shrieking. The tendrils of mist solidify and flicker towards Joya, the ends transformed into blades. Quick as a cat she dodges aside, spinning to avoid the cuts, twirling to a stop facing him. The shrieking stops suddenly. Joya grins "No problem Corran - it'll take more ...". Her words are cut short as three tendrils whip out of the walls and floor, blades whistling through the air and slashing into her. A look of shock crosses her face, her eyes suddenly wide. She stares at him - "Shoan..." - her hand reaches out, trembling. Then she collapsed to the floor with a soft sigh. Shoan cries out but his scream is cut short as the floor beneath him vanishes and he plummets into darkness.*

Shoan jumps forwards - "Joya! Are you ok? It's me, Shoan!"

> [!oracle] Has Joya lost her memories of Shoan?
> **Roll:** 31 / 50-59
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

Joya's arms slowly move away from her head. She braces her hands on the floor and pushes herself to her feet, her back to Shoan. She stands for a moment, her shoulders moving as she is breathing heavily. Slowly she turns towards him, her face lifting to look at him.

> [!oracle] Is she hostile towards Shoan?
> **Roll:** 63 / 50-50
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** None

Shoan steps back away from her. "Joya? ... Joya, it's me Shoan."

"She is no longer Joya." - Thaeox voice is matter if fact, friendly still. " She is more than that now. She is part of the obelisk, part of me. She has never been. More perfect."

Shoan takes another step back as Joya faces him. Her face is expressionless. Shoan swears under his breath as he sees her eyes. They are blank, dark glass, swirling motes of light within them. She steps forwards and Shoan sees threads of the dark glass woven into the skin of her neck. Her hand reaches for her sword and she unsheathes it purposefully.

"Joya! Calvel's eyes - don't you know me? Joya!!"
