Shoan is standing at the edge of a huge chamber. It seems larger than should be possible given the dimensions of the obelisk. The chamber is vaulted with vast arches sweeping upwards towards a central point in the darkness above. The walls seem to be made of some sort of dark glass, spidered with cracks and fissures. The floor of the chamber seems to be made of a similar glass-like substance and is luminescent, a dim blue-green glow illuminating the smooth surface.

The chamber seems to be deserted apart from what looks like a darkly gleaming rod of metal or glass which is floating suspended a few feet from the ground in the centre of the chamber, directly below the confluence of the vault arches.
